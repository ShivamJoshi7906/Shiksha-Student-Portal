The Shiksha-Student-Portal is a fully integrated, full-stack web application built on PHP and MySQL that acts as a centralized administrative and academic hub.

The site delivers a unified experience across informational modules like Faculty Details, Placement, Events, and NEP 2020 through a consistent, dark-themed interface. Its core strength is a secure user management system featuring CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality, protected by Bcrypt password hashing and strict Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) via PHP Sessions. Security is robust, utilizing Prepared Statements to prevent SQL injection and htmlspecialchars() to guard against XSS, ensuring data integrity and a reliable environment. The Admin Dashboard also includes Operational Analytics for system oversight.
